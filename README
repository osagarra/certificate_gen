	List of contributions: posters.txt
	.tex DOcument with the spot where "name" field should appear marked as NNAMEE and the contribution name (poster field) as PPOSTERR. Place the doc at the same folder
	Output files are created in folder output	
	Images can be added to the .tex doc: Put them in './fig'
	To run the script: './python certificate_gen.py'
        YOu need to have pdflatex installed, if you have another latex compiler change the lines in the code as specified.
